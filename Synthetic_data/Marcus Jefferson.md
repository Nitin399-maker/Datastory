# Medical Reports: Marcus Jefferson

**Position:** Defensive Tackle

**ID:** 99881100

**DOB:** 07/07/2003

## Analytical Hypothesis (Ground Truth)

*For Internal Verification Use Only*

**Hypothesis:** \"The Solitary Kidney Risk.\" The player was born with
only one kidney (Renal Agenesis). While usually playable, he has
**Proteinuria** and **Hypertension**. This combination suggests the
solitary kidney is under stress (Hyperfiltration Injury). An NFL career
involves high protein intake, NSAID use (Toradol), and dehydration---all
toxic to a stressed solitary kidney.

**Risk Profile:** High (Long-term Health/Longevity).

## Imaging Reports

### Ultrasound: Renal (Kidneys) / Abdomen

**Date:** 02/26/2026

**Indication:** Elevated Creatinine, Proteinuria.

**Findings:**

- **Left Kidney:** **Not visualized.** Consistent with congenital renal
  agenesis.

- **Right Kidney:** Compensatory hypertrophy. Measures 13.5 cm in length
  (Enlarged). Echotexture is slightly echogenic (suggesting mild medical
  renal disease).

- **Bladder:** Normal.

**Impression:**

1.  **Solitary Right Kidney** (Congenital).

2.  Compensatory hypertrophy of the right kidney.

3.  Mild increased echogenicity of the right kidney, clinically
    correlated with proteinuria.
