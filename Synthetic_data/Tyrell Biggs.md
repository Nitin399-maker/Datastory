# Medical Reports: Tyrell Biggs

**Position:** Edge Rusher

**ID:** 99011234

**DOB:** 09/10/2004

## Analytical Hypothesis (Ground Truth)

*For Internal Verification Use Only*

**Hypothesis:** \"The Cardiac Red Flag.\" This is not \"Athlete\'s
Heart.\" The player exhibits signs of **Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy
(HCM)**. The key differentiators are the septal thickness (\>15mm) and
the specific behavior of the murmur (louder with Valsalva).

**Risk Profile:** Critical/Life-Threatening. High probability of medical
disqualification by team doctors.

## General Medical Evaluation

**Date:** February 26, 2026

**Provider:** Matthew Martinez, MD (Cardiology Consultant)

### History

- **Symptoms:** Reports occasional \"lightheadedness\" upon standing up
  quickly. Denies syncope (passing out) during games, but admits to
  needing extra recovery time after long drives due to \"windedness.\"

- **Family History:** Uncle died suddenly at age 35 (\"Heart Attack\").

- **Medications:** None.

### Physical Examination

- **Height/Weight:** 6\'5\", 265 lbs.

- **Vitals:** BP 110/65, HR 60.

- **Cardiac Auscultation:**

  - **Murmur:** Grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard best at the
    left sternal border.

  - **Dynamic Maneuvers:**

    - *Valsalva/Standing:* Murmur **increases** in intensity (Pathologic
      sign).

    - *Squatting:* Murmur **decreases** in intensity.

## Orthopedic Evaluation

**Date:** February 27, 2026

**Provider:** James Andrews, MD

**Missed Time:**

- 2025: Missed 1 game (Concussion).

### Injury History

1.  **Shoulders:** Bilateral AC joint sprains in 2023. Treated
    conservatively. Full ROM.

2.  **Knees:** Clean.

3.  **Spine:** Clean.

## Diagnostic Reports

### EKG (12-Lead)

**Date:** 02/26/2026

**Findings:**

- Sinus Rhythm.

- **Deep Q-Waves** in leads II, III, aVF (Inferior leads).

- Significant Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH) with strain pattern.

- T-wave inversion in V4-V6.

### Transthoracic Echocardiogram

**Date:** 02/26/2026

**Indication:** Murmur, abnormal EKG.

**Findings:**

- **Left Ventricle:** Asymmetric Septal Hypertrophy.

- **Wall Thickness:** Interventricular Septum (IVS) measures **17 mm**
  at end-diastole (Normal \< 12mm; \"Athlete\'s Heart\" gray zone is
  13-15mm). Posterior wall measures 11 mm.

- **Function:** Ejection Fraction 65% (Hyperdynamic).

- **Outflow Tract:** Resting LVOT gradient is 20 mmHg. Provocable
  gradient (Valsalva) rises to 45 mmHg (Obstruction present).

- **Mitral Valve:** Systolic Anterior Motion (SAM) of the mitral valve
  leaflet noted.

**Impression:**

1.  Findings consistent with **Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy
    (HOCM)**.

2.  Significant septal wall thickness (17mm) outside the range of normal
    physiologic athletic adaptation.

3.  Dynamic Left Ventricular Outflow Tract (LVOT) obstruction.
