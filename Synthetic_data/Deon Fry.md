# Medical Reports: Deon Fry

**Position:** Running Back

**ID:** 22005581

**DOB:** 04/18/2004

## Analytical Hypothesis (Ground Truth)

*For Internal Verification Use Only*

**Hypothesis:** \"The Ankle Time Bomb.\" This is not just a \"stiff
ankle.\" The MRI shows an **Unstable Osteochondral Defect (OCD)** of the
Talus. The \"fluid signal behind the fragment\" is the critical
finding---it means the piece of cartilage/bone is loose and could detach
at any moment, causing the joint to lock up.

**Risk Profile:** High. Requires surgery (fixation or cartilage
transfer) to prevent joint locking.

## General Medical Evaluation

**Date:** February 26, 2026

**Provider:** Robert Heyer, MD

### History

- **General:** No chronic illness.

- **Sickle Cell:** Negative.

### Physical Examination

- **Height/Weight:** 5\'11\", 215 lbs.

- **Ankles:** Right ankle appears slightly swollen compared to left.

## Orthopedic Evaluation

**Date:** February 27, 2026

**Provider:** Martin O\'Malley, MD (Foot/Ankle)

**Missed Time:**

- 2024: Missed 3 games (\"High Ankle Sprain\").

- 2025: Limited in practice weeks 8-12 due to \"Ankle soreness.\"

### Injury History

1.  **Right Ankle:**

    - *History:* Sustained eversion sprain in 2024. Since then, reports
      intermittent \"catching\" or \"clicking\" deep inside the joint.
      Says the ankle \"locks up\" occasionally in the morning.

    - *Exam:*

      - **Effusion:** Moderate joint effusion present.

      - **ROM:** Dorsiflexion limited by 5 degrees (hard end point).

      - **Tenderness:** Palpable pain at the medial gutter (inside
        corner).

      - **Stability:** Anterior drawer and Talar tilt negative
        (Ligaments are stable).

2.  **Left Knee:** ACL Repair (2020 - High School). Graft is solid. No
    issues.

## Imaging Reports

### MRI: Right Ankle W/O Contrast

**Date:** 02/26/2026

**Indication:** Chronic pain, catching.

**Findings:**

- **Talar Dome:** There is a
  ![](media/image1.png){width="0.5489905949256343in"
  height="0.23824146981627298in"} mm osteochondral lesion on the
  **medial talar dome**.

- **Stability Signs:** High T2 fluid signal is seen rimming the deep
  interface between the fragment and the parent bone (The \"Rim Sign\").
  There is a breach of the cartilage surface.

- **Bone Marrow:** Significant edema in the talus surrounding the
  lesion.

- **Ligaments:** ATFL and CFL are thickened/scarred but intact. AITFL
  (Syndesmosis) is intact.

**Impression:**

1.  **Unstable Osteochondral Defect (OCD)** of the Medial Talar Dome
    (![](media/image1.png){width="0.5489905949256343in"
    height="0.23824146981627298in"} mm).

2.  Positive \"Rim Sign\" indicating fluid undermining the fragment
    (Instability).

3.  Joint effusion and synovitis.
