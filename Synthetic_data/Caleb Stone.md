## Analytical Hypothesis (Ground Truth)

*For Internal Verification Use Only*

**Hypothesis:** \"The Hidden Non-Union.\" The player has a **Scaphoid
Non-Union** in his snapping hand. He has been playing through it with
tape, but the X-ray shows sclerosis and cyst formation (SNAC wrist
precursor). He cannot effectively punch or snap without eventual surgery
(bone graft), which implies a 4-6 month recovery.

**Risk Profile:** High Immediate Surgical Risk.

## Orthopedic Evaluation

**Date:** February 27, 2026

**Provider:** Thomas Graham, MD (Hand Specialist)

**Missed Time:**

- 2023: Missed 2 games (\"Wrist Sprain\").

- 2024/2025: No games missed, but played with a hard cast club (2024)
  and heavy tape (2025).

### Injury History

1.  **Right Wrist (Dominant/Snapping Hand):**

    - *History:* Injured wrist falling on outstretched hand in 2023.
      Treated as a sprain. Pain persists in the \"thumb side\" of the
      wrist, especially when punching or blocking.

    - *Exam:*

      - **Palpation:** Tenderness in the Anatomic Snuffbox and Scaphoid
        Tubercle.

      - **ROM:** Extension limited to 45 degrees (Left is 70). Flexion
        is 50 degrees.

      - **Strength:** Grip strength 40kg (Right) vs 55kg (Left).
        Watson\'s Scaphoid Shift test causes painful clunk.

2.  **Knees:** Bilateral mild patellar tendinitis. No tears.

## Imaging Reports

### XR: Right Wrist (4 Views including Scaphoid View)

**Date:** 02/26/2026

**Findings:**

- **Scaphoid:** Persistent radiolucent line through the waist (middle
  third) of the scaphoid bone.

- **Edges:** The fracture margins appear sclerotic (white/hardened),
  indicating chronicity.

- **Cystic Changes:** Small cystic changes noted at the fracture site.

- **Alignment:** Minimal dorsal intercalated segment instability (DISI)
  deformity (Lunate tilting back).

- **Arthritis:** Mild radioscaphoid joint space narrowing.

**Impression:**

1.  **Established Scaphoid Waist Non-Union.**

2.  Sclerotic margins suggest low likelihood of spontaneous healing.

3.  Early signs of Scaphoid Non-Union Advanced Collapse (SNAC) pattern
    arthritis.
