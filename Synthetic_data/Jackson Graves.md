# Medical Reports: Jackson Graves

**Position:** Offensive Tackle

**ID:** 77100293

**DOB:** 02/14/2003

## Analytical Hypothesis (Ground Truth)

*For Internal Verification Use Only*

**Hypothesis:** \"The Jones Fracture Prodrome.\" The player has **Pes
Cavus (High Arches)** which places excessive load on the lateral foot.
The imaging shows cortical thickening at the base of the 5th metatarsal.
This is a \"stress reaction\" warning sign. If he plays at NFL
weight/speed without surgical fixation or orthotics, he is at extremely
high risk for a Jones Fracture (non-union prone).

**Risk Profile:** High (Foot fracture risk).

      camp 2025. Taped heavily to play.

    - *Exam:*

      - **Structure:** Bilateral Pes Cavus (High Arches) with varus
        hindfoot alignment (walks on outside of feet).

      - **Palpation:** Point tenderness at the base of the 5th
        metatarsal.

      - **Strength:** Peroneals strong.

## Imaging Reports

### XR: Foot Left (3 Views)

**Date:** 02/26/2026

**Findings:**

- **5th Metatarsal:** There is **focal cortical thickening** and
  sclerosis at the metaphyseal-diaphyseal junction (Zone 2). No frank
  fracture line is seen, but the cortex is thickened compared to the
  right side.

- **Alignment:** Cavovarus foot deformity.

- **Joints:** Midfoot joints are congruent.

### MRI: Left Foot W/O Contrast

**Date:** 02/26/2026

**Indication:** Chronic lateral foot pain.

**Findings:**

- **Bone Marrow:** Grade 2 bone marrow edema within the proximal shaft
  of the 5th metatarsal (Zone 2/3 junction).

- **Cortex:** Intracortical signal abnormality consistent with a
  **stress reaction**.

- **Soft Tissue:** Mild peroneal tendonitis.

- **Lisfranc:** Ligament is intact.

**Impression:**

1.  Symptomatic Stress Reaction of the proximal 5th metatarsal (Zone 2).
    Warning sign for impending Jones Fracture.

2.  Underlying Pes Cavus varus deformity (predisposing factor).

3.  No acute fracture line identified at this time.
