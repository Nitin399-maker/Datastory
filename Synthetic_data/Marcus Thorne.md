## Analytical Hypothesis (Ground Truth)

*For Internal Verification Use Only*

**Hypothesis:** \"Accelerated Degeneration.\" The player has a \"2nd
Contract Risk.\" While currently playable, the history of partial
meniscectomy combined with Grade 3 chondromalacia indicates a high
probability of arthritic decline within 3-4 years.

**Risk Profile:** Low acute injury risk, High chronic degradation risk.

## Imaging Reports

### MRI: Knee W/O Contrast Left

**Date:** 02/26/2026

**Indication:** History of meniscectomy, chronic effusion.

**Findings:**

- **Lateral Meniscus:** Diminutive size and blunting of the body and
  anterior horn consistent with prior partial meniscectomy. No acute
  tear seen in the remnant.

- **Cartilage (Lateral Compartment):** **Grade 3 Chondromalacia**
  (fissuring/fibrillation \>50% depth) involving the lateral femoral
  condyle.

- **Cartilage (Patella):** Grade 2 chondral changes at the medial facet.

- **Joint:** Moderate joint effusion. Synovitis present.

- **Ligaments:** ACL graft (if applicable) not present (native ACL
  intact). PCL intact.

**Impression:**

1.  Post-surgical changes consistent with partial lateral meniscectomy.

2.  Advanced premature osteoarthritis in the lateral compartment (Grade
    3 chondral defects).

3.  Active synovitis and moderate effusion.

### XR: Knee Standing AP/Lateral (Bilateral)

**Date:** 02/26/2026

**Findings:**

- **Left Knee:** Mild to moderate narrowing of the lateral joint space
  compared to the right. Small osteophytes (bone spurs) noted at the
