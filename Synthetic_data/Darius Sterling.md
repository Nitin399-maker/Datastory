**Position:** Wide Receiver

**ID:** 88421009

**DOB:** 08/12/2004

## Analytical Hypothesis (Ground Truth)

*For Internal Verification Use Only*

**Hypothesis:** Patient exhibits \"Kinetic Chain Disruption.\" Recurrent
hamstring strains are likely secondary to lumbar instability (L5 pars
defect) and anterior pelvic tilt, rather than isolated muscle weakness.

**Risk Profile:** High short-term recurrence risk if core stability is
not prioritized over static stretching.

## General Medical Evaluation

**Date:** February 26, 2026

**Provider:** Sarah Jenkins, MD

### History

- **Medical Conditions:** Childhood asthma (resolved, no inhaler use
  since age 14).

- **Sickle Cell Trait:** Negative.

- **Concussion History:** One concussion (Sophomore year, 2023). Cleared
  after 6 days. No recurrence.

- **Social:** Non-smoker. Rare alcohol use.

### Physical Examination

- **Height/Weight:** 6\'0\", 195 lbs.

- **Vitals:** BP 118/76, HR 58 (Resting).

- **Lungs:** Clear. Normal peak flow.

- **General:** Athletic build, notable anterior pelvic tilt observed in
  standing posture.

### Data Review

- **Labs:** Normal. CPK slightly elevated (consistent with recent
  training).

- **EKG:** Sinus Bradycardia (athletic heart). Normal voltage.

## Orthopedic Evaluation

**Date:** February 27, 2026

**Provider:** James Andrews II, MD

**Missed Time:**

- 2024 Season: Missed 2 games (Right Hamstring).

- 2025 Season: Missed 3 games (Right Hamstring).

### Injury History

1.  **Right Hamstring (Recurrent):**

    - *History:* Initial Grade 1 strain Oct 2024. Recurrence Grade 2
      strain Sept 2025. Both non-contact, occurred during top-speed
      deceleration.

    - *Exam:* No current tenderness. Strength 5/5 but pain reported at
      extreme hip flexion.

    - *Special Tests:* Popliteal angle 15 degrees (tight). Slump test
      positive on Right (suggesting neural tension).

2.  **Lumbar Spine:**

    - *History:* Episodes of \"tight lower back\" after games. No
      radicular pain (sciatica) reported.

    - *Exam:* Extension causes mild discomfort at L5 level. Flexion is
      painless.

    - *Imaging:* MRI confirms old injury (see below).

3.  **Ankles:**

    - *History:* Bilateral prophylactic taping. No sprains.

    - *Exam:* Stable.

## Imaging Reports

### MRI: Right Thigh (Hamstring)

**Date:** 02/26/2026

**Findings:**

- **Musculotendinous Junction:** Fusiform thickening of the proximal
  biceps femoris tendon consistent with chronic scarring.

- **Edema:** Trace residual perifascial edema surrounding the biceps
  femoris. No acute fluid collection.

- **Sciatic Nerve:** Evaluation demonstrates mild tethering of the
  sciatic nerve adjacent to the scar tissue at the ischial tuberosity.

### MRI: Lumbar Spine W/O Contrast

**Date:** 02/26/2026

**Indication:** Chronic low back tightness.

**Findings:**

- **L5-S1:** Bilateral pars interarticularis defects at L5. These appear
  sclerotic and healed (chronic spondylolysis). No active marrow edema.

- **Alignment:** Grade 1 anterolisthesis (slippage) of L5 on S1. Stable
  in flexion/extension views.

- **Discs:** Mild disc desiccation at L5-S1. No nerve root impingement.

**Impression:**

1.  Chronic, healed bilateral L5 pars defects with stable Grade 1 Grade
    1 spondylolisthesis.

2.  Scarring of the right proximal biceps femoris (hamstring) with mild
    sciatic nerve tethering.
