# Medical Reports: Elijah Banks

**Position:** Linebacker

**ID:** 55001928

**DOB:** 06/30/2003

## Analytical Hypothesis (Ground Truth)

*For Internal Verification Use Only*

**Hypothesis:** \"Functional Cervical Stenosis.\" The player has
congenital narrowing of the spinal canal. While not currently
symptomatic, his Torg Ratio is \< 0.8. He has a history of \"stingers.\"
The risk is that a significant axial load event could cause **Transient
Quadriparesis** (temporary paralysis) or end his career prematurely.

**Risk Profile:** High (Catastrophic Injury Risk/Career Longevity).

## General Medical Evaluation

**Date:** February 26, 2026

**Provider:** Thom Mayer, MD

### History

- **General:** Healthy.

- **Concussion:** 2 documented concussions (2022, 2024). Last one
  required 14 days protocol.

- **Neck:** Reports \"burners\" (shooting pain down arm) approx 3 times
  per season. usually resolve in minutes.

### Physical Examination

- **Height/Weight:** 6\'2\", 240 lbs.

- **Vitals:** BP 128/74, HR 62.

- **Neuro:** Cranial nerves II-XII intact. Sensation intact to light
  touch.

## Orthopedic Evaluation

**Date:** February 27, 2026

**Provider:** Andrew Hecht, MD

**Missed Time:**

- 2024: Left game early vs. Alabama (Neck/Stinger). Returned next week.

### Injury History

1.  **Cervical Spine:**

    - *History:* Recurrent stingers affecting right arm. Sensation of
      \"dead arm\" lasts 30-60 seconds.

    - *Exam:*

      - **ROM:** Full flexion/extension. Extension with lateral bending
        to the right causes mild paresthesia in thumb (Positive
        Spurling\'s Maneuver).

      - **Reflexes:** 2+ Biceps, Triceps, Brachioradialis. No
        Hoffmann\'s sign (no spinal cord compression signs).

      - **Strength:** Deltoid 5/5, Biceps 5/5, Triceps 5/5, Grip 5/5.

2.  **Right Shoulder:**

    - *History:* AC Joint sprain 2023.

    - *Exam:* Mild prominence of AC joint. Nontender.

## Imaging Reports

### MRI: Cervical Spine W/O Contrast

**Date:** 02/26/2026

**Indication:** Recurrent stingers.

**Findings:**

- **Canal Diameter:** Congenitally narrow spinal canal. Mid-sagittal
  diameter measures **10-11 mm** from C3 to C6 (Normal \> 14mm).

- **Cord:** The spinal cord is slightly flattened but there is **no
  myelomalacia** (no cord signal change/damage). The CSF signal around
  the cord is effaced (diminished buffer).

- **Discs:** Mild disc bulges at C4-5 and C5-6, contacting the ventral
  cord but not compressing it.

- **Foramina:** Mild narrowing of the right C5-6 neural foramen (exit
  route for the nerve root).

**Impression:**

1.  **Congenital Cervical Stenosis.** Torg Ratio estimated \< 0.8.

2.  Effacement of the CSF column C3-C6 due to narrow canal + mild disc
    bulges.

3.  No intrinsic spinal cord signal abnormality (no current injury to
    the cord).

4.  Mild right C5-6 foraminal stenosis (correlates with stinger
    symptoms).
