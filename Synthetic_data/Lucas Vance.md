# Medical Reports: Lucas Vance

**Position:** Quarterback

**ID:** 12100558

**DOB:** 05/22/2003

## Analytical Hypothesis (Ground Truth)

*For Internal Verification Use Only*

**Hypothesis:** \"Distal Compensation Risk.\" The shoulder repair is
structurally sound, but the patient has developed GIRD (Glenohumeral
Internal Rotation Deficit). This lack of shoulder rotation is forcing
the elbow to accept excessive valgus load, creating a high risk for UCL
(Tommy John) injury despite the shoulder being \"healed.\"

**Risk Profile:** Medium-High (Elbow), Low (Shoulder Recurrence).

## General Medical Evaluation

**Date:** February 26, 2026

**Provider:** Allen Sills, MD

### History

- **General:** No chronic illnesses.

- **Concussion:** 1 diagnosed in high school. None in college.

- **Medications:** None.

### Physical Examination

- **Height/Weight:** 6\'3\", 220 lbs.

- **Hand Size:** 9.5 inches.

- **General:** Neurovascularly intact. Grip strength symmetrical.

## Orthopedic Evaluation

**Date:** February 27, 2026

**Provider:** Neal ElAttrache, MD

**Missed Time:**

- 2024 Season: Missed last 3 games (Right Shoulder Surgery).

### Injury History

1.  **Right Shoulder (Throwing):**

    - *History:* Type 2 SLAP (Superior Labrum) tear Nov 2024. Repaired
      arthroscopically.

    - *Current Status:* Reports shoulder feels \"tight\" but strong. No
      pain with throwing, but velocity drops late in practice.

    - *Exam (Range of Motion):*

      - **External Rotation (ER):** 110 degrees (Excessive/Laxity).

      - **Internal Rotation (IR):** 35 degrees (Significant deficit).

      - *Note:* Total Arc of Motion is preserved, but shifted
        significantly towards ER.

    - *Strength:* 5/5 rotator cuff.

2.  **Right Elbow:**

    - *History:* Occasional medial elbow soreness reported during
      rehabilitation phase.

    - *Exam:* Mild tenderness over the Ulnar Collateral Ligament (UCL).
      Valgus stress test at 30 degrees is negative (stable), but causes
      mild discomfort. Moving Valgus Stress Test is equivocal.

3.  **Left Knee:**

    - *History:* Clean.

    - *Exam:* Stable.

## Imaging Reports

### MRI: Shoulder Arthrogram Right

**Date:** 02/26/2026

**Indication:** Post-op evaluation, loss of internal rotation.

**Technique:** Intra-articular contrast administered.

**Findings:**

- **Labrum:** Suture anchors from prior SLAP repair are in good
  position. Superior labrum appears healed and attached to the glenoid
  rim.

- **Capsule:** Significant thickening of the posterior inferior
  glenohumeral ligament (PIGHL) and posterior capsule.

- **Rotator Cuff:** Intact. No tears.

- **Bones:** No Hill-Sachs lesion.

**Impression:**

1.  Intact SLAP repair with no evidence of recurrent tear.

2.  Marked posterior capsular thickening/fibrosis (consistent with
    clinical GIRD).

### Ultrasound: Right Elbow (Dynamic)

**Date:** 02/26/2026

**Indication:** Medial elbow soreness.

**Findings:**

- **UCL:** Anterior bundle of the UCL is thickened (chronic remodeling).
  No acute tear or high-grade partial tear identified.

- **Dynamic Stress:** With valgus stress, there is 1.5mm of joint
  gapping (mild laxity, common in throwers) but end-point is firm.

- **Flexor Mass:** Mild inflammation at the common flexor origin.

**Impression:**

1.  Thickened UCL consistent with \"Thrower\'s Elbow.\"

2.  No acute rupture.

3.  Mild Flexor-Pronator mass strain.
