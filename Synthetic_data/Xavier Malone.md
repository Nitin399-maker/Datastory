# Medical Reports: Xavier Malone

**Position:** Cornerback

**ID:** 22910447

**DOB:** 11/04/2003

## Analytical Hypothesis (Ground Truth)

*For Internal Verification Use Only*

**Hypothesis:** \"The FAI Trap.\" The player\'s recurrent \"groin
strains\" are a misdiagnosis. The root cause is **Femoroacetabular
Impingement (FAI)**---specifically a Cam lesion. The bony overgrowth is
shredding the labrum and destabilizing the pelvis, causing secondary
adductor pain.

**Risk Profile:** High. Likely requires hip arthroscopy (surgery) within
12-18 months to fix the bone impingement, otherwise soft tissue injuries
will persist.

### Physical Examination

- **Height/Weight:** 6\'1\", 205 lbs.

## Orthopedic Evaluation

**Date:** February 28, 2026

**Provider:** Marc Philippon, MD

**Missed Time:**

- 2024: Missed 2 games (\"Groin Strain\").

- 2025: Missed 3 games (\"Hip Flexor Strain\").

### Injury History

1.  **Right Hip/Groin:**

    - *History:* Chronic deep ache in the groin after heavy squatting or
      cutting. Diagnosed repeatedly as adductor strains.

    - *Exam:*

      - **FADIR Test:** Strongly Positive (Flexion, Adduction, Internal
        Rotation reproduces deep groin pain).

      - **FABER Test:** Positive (posterior hip pain).

      - **Range of Motion:** Internal Rotation limited to 10 degrees
        (stiff) compared to 35 degrees on the left.

    - *Strength:* Adductor strength 4/5 (pain inhibition).

2.  **Core:**

    - *History:* \"Sports Hernia\" evaluation in 2024 was negative for
      tear, treated with rehab.

    - *Exam:* Tenderness at the pubic tubercle.

3.  **Shoulders:**

    - *History:* Left AC joint separation (Grade 1) in 2023.

    - *Exam:* Painless full ROM.

## Imaging Reports

### X-Ray: Pelvis AP and Frog-Leg Lateral

**Date:** 02/27/2026

**Findings:**

- **Right Hip:** \"Pistol Grip\" deformity of the proximal femur. Loss
  of femoral head-neck offset.

- **Alpha Angle:** Measured at 68 degrees (Normal is \<55), indicating
  significant **Cam-type impingement**.

- **Joint Space:** Preserved. No arthritis.

### MRI: Right Hip Arthrography

**Date:** 02/27/2026

**Technique:** Intra-articular gadolinium.

**Findings:**

- **Labrum:** Anterosuperior labral tear (approx 12 o\'clock to 2
  o\'clock position) with localized perilabral cyst.

- **Cartilage:** Small area of delamination (chondral flap) at the
  chondrolabral junction, corresponding to the impingement zone.

- **Bone:** Large Cam lesion on the femoral neck.

- **Soft Tissue:** Mild edema in the adductor longus origin (secondary
  strain).

**Impression:**

1.  Femoroacetabular Impingement (FAI) with large Cam lesion.

2.  Anterosuperior labral tear.

3.  Focal Grade 2 chondral delamination.

4.  Reactive adductor tendinosis (secondary to hip pathology).
